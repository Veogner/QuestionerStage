## OFFICAL 9362 Github Page

## NOTICE

This repository contains the public FTC SDK, and the Code for the Samurai Robotics(9362), for the 2024-2025 FTC Year.
THIS PROJECT WILL ONLY BE MAINTAINED FOR THE 2024-2025 FTC YEAR.

## Requirements
To use this Android Studio, or IntelliJ Idea, and Permission from the Samurai Roboitcs, we recommned that you use a laptop with a GPU and 1gb of spalce.

## Downloading the Project
If you are an Android Studio or IntelliJprogrammer, there are several ways to download this repo.  Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.

* If you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController.git</p>

* Or, if you prefer, you can use the "Download Zip" button available through the main repository page.  Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.

* You can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads subsection of the [Releases](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/releases) page for this repository.

* The Releases page also contains prebuilt APKs.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").

# Release Information

## Version 9.1 (20240215-115542)

### Enhancements
* Fixes a problem with Blocks: if the user closes a Block's warning balloon, it will still be closed next time the project is opened in the Blocks editor.
* In the Blocks editor, an alert concerning missing hardware devices is not shown if all the Blocks that use the missing hardware devices are disabled.
* Adds Blocks to support comparing property values CRServo.Direction, DCMotor.Direction, DCMotor.Mode, DCMotor.ZeroPowerBehavior, DigitalChannel.Mode, GyroSensor.HeadingMode, IrSeekerSensor.Mode, and Servo.Direction, to the corresponding enum Block.
* Improves OnBotJava auto-import to correctly import classes when used in certain situations.
* Improves OnBotJava autocomplete to provide better completion options in most cases.
  * This fixes an issue where autocomplete would fail if a method with two or more formal parameters was defined.
* In OnBotJava, code folding support was added to expand and collapse code sections
* In OnBotJava, the copyright header is now automatically collapsed loading new files
* For all Blocks OpMode samples, intro comments have been moved to the RunOpMode comment balloon.
* The Clean up Blocks command in the Blocks editor now positions function Blocks so their comment balloons don't overlap other function Blocks.
* Added Blocks OpMode sample SensorTouch.
* Added Java OpMode sample SensorDigitalTouch.
* Several improvements to VisionPortal
  * Adds option to control whether the stream is automatically started following a `.build()` call on a VisionPortal Builder
  * Adds option to control whether the vision processing statistics overlay is rendered or not
  * VisionPortals now implement the `CameraStreamSource` interface, allowing multiportal users to select which portal is routed to the DS in INIT by calling CameraStreamServer.getInstance().setSource(visionPortal). Can be selected via gamepad, between Camera Stream sessions.
  * Add option to `AprilTagProcessor` to suppress calibration warnings
  * Improves camera calibration warnings
    * If a calibration is scaled, the resolution it was scaled from will be listed
    * If calibrations exist with the wrong aspect ratio, the calibrated resolutions will be listed
  * Fixes race condition which caused app crash when calling `stopStreaming()` immediately followed by `close()` on a VisionPortal
  * Fixes IllegalStateException when calling `stopStreaming()` immediately after building a VisionPortal
  * Added FTC Blocks counterparts to new Java methods:
    * VisionPortal.Builder.setAutoStartStreamOnBuild
    * VisionPortal.Builder.setShowStatsOverlay
    * AprilTagProcessor.Builder.setSuppressCalibrationWarnings
    * CameraStreamServer.setSourceâ€‹

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes a problem where OnBotJava does not apply font size settings to the editor.
* Updates EasyOpenCV dependency to v1.7.1
  * Fixes inability to use EasyOpenCV CameraFactory in OnBotJava
  * Fixes entire RC app crash when user pipeline throws an exception
  * Fixes entire RC app crash when user user canvas annotator throws an exception
  * Use the modern stacktrace display when handling user exceptions instead of the legacy ESTOP telemetry message
